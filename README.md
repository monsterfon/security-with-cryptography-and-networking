# Security with Cryptography and Privacy

This repository contains **eight projects** focused on **Information Security and Privacy**. The projects are split into two main categories:

1. **Java Cryptography**: Four exercises that utilize Java's cryptography libraries to implement security-related concepts.
2. **Networking and Virtual Machines**: Four exercises involving virtual machines, IPsec, VPN, SSH, and general networking security protocols.

These projects were created as part of the course **Information Security and Privacy**, and they provide a hands-on experience with cryptographic algorithms, network security, and privacy techniques.

## Projects Overview

### Java Cryptography Exercises (4 Projects)
These exercises focus on implementing cryptographic algorithms and techniques using Java's cryptography libraries. The projects demonstrate how cryptography can be applied in real-world scenarios for securing data and communications.

#### Key Features:
- Implementations of symmetric and asymmetric encryption.
- Using hashing algorithms like SHA-256.
- Digital signatures and message authentication codes (MACs).
- Key generation, management, and distribution techniques.

### Networking and Virtual Machines Exercises (4 Projects)
These exercises involve setting up virtual machines and configuring network security protocols such as **IPsec**, **VPN**, and **SSH**. They focus on securing data transmitted over networks and ensuring private, encrypted communication.

#### Key Features:
- Configuring **IPsec** for secure communication.
- Setting up a **VPN** for private, encrypted tunneling.
- Using **SSH** for secure remote access.
- General networking security principles.

## Technologies and Libraries Used:
- **Java** for cryptographic implementations.
- **Virtual Machines** for running network security exercises.
- **IPsec**, **VPN**, **SSH** for networking and security protocols.
- **Linux** environments for network configuration and testing.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Follow the instructions in each project folder for setting up and running the exercises.
3. For Java cryptography projects, compile and run the Java code using your preferred IDE or command line.
4. For networking projects, set up virtual machines as instructed and configure the network security protocols.
